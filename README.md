# C# Learning
A repository for storing code and lessons on the path to learning C#

## Approach
I will follow the approach outlined in Tim Corey's video The Path to C# in 2024

## The Preparation
1. **Identify the steps I'm going to take** – Define the key milestones in the learning path.
2. **Build a learning list** – Organize topics in a structured format, ensuring a gradual learning curve.
3. **Prepare to Practice** – Set up an environment with an IDE (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, or VS Code), necessary SDKs, and essential tools.
4. **Eliminate the distractions** – Schedule focused learning time, minimize interruptions, and use tools like Pomodoro timers if necessary.

   
## The Process
1. **Learn a new topic** – Study theoretical concepts through videos, courses, and documentation.
2. **Create 2 - 5 practice projects** – Apply learning through small exercises or feature-based projects.
3. **Repeat steps 1 & 2** – Reinforce learning through repeated practice.
4. **Create a small (tiny) practice project using learned topics** – A self-contained project that combines multiple concepts.
5. **Implement in production** – Work on real-world applications, open-source projects, or personal utilities.
6. **Evaluate your progress** – Reflect on what has been learned, identify gaps, and adjust the approach.
